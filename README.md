# Horiseon Social Soltion Services Refactor

Horiseon's front page lacked optimal HTML semantics and search optimization. 

## This has been fixed by:

- [x] CHANGING most divs to more appropriate elements, updating relevant css references.
- [x] ADDING "alt"s to images to allow for screen reading compatibility.
- [x] HTML and CSS code organized and labled for clearity.
- [x] FIXED broken/incomplete links.
